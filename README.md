# AHIR-Toolchain
This repository provides a docker implementation for the AHIR Toolchain.
AhirV2 is a set of tools which can convert a C description of a system to an
equivalent hardware implementation (described in VHDL). Using these tools,
it is possible to take an algorithmic approach to the design of hardware.
